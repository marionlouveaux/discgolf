\section{How to setup}{

You can set your url, username, and api key either using R options or
environment variables. I recommend using environment variables since
they are more general to any programming language, and you can easily
set secure env vars on a server or e.g., if you're doing continuous
integration on Travis-CI (or elsewhere).

You used to be able to pass user name and api key via function
parameters, but that option has been removed to reduce likelihood of a
user accidentally including either of those in a public website.

\section{URL}{

The base URL for the Discourse instance, e.g., \verb{https://meta.discourse.org}

Use one of:
\itemize{
\item Env var name: \code{DISCOURSE_URL}
\item R option name: \code{discourse_url}
}
}

\section{Username}{

The user name you have registered on the Discourse instance you want
to use.

Use one of:
\itemize{
\item Env var name: \code{DISCOURSE_USERNAME}
\item R option name: \code{discourse_username}
}
}

\section{API key}{

The API key on the Discourse instance you want to use. This is not your
password you used to login to the instance. If you're the admin, you can get
an API key by going the dashboard at \code{base_url/admin}, then the API tab
\code{base_url/admin/api}, then generate a key, or copy the one already there.

Use one of:
\itemize{
\item Env var name: \code{DISCOURSE_API_KEY}
\item R option name: \code{discourse_api_key}
}
}
